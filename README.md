# dotfiles

These dotfiles will hopefully be helpful to those who are looking
for some examples of how to configure some popular utilities.
I find that many of the older well-established utilities had little
documentation on some of the more exotic features they provide.

Therefore, I have included all the crazy hacks I've implemented over
time to produce an easily configurable and maintainable desktop.

Enjoy.
