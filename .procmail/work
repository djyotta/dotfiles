# Recipes
# The aim of these recipes is to move the files
# that offlineimap stores in MAILDIR into 
# appropriate directories.
# Hence, procmail is run like:
#   procmail && rm <processed-mail>
# so that offlineimap will pick up on the moved
# file and not simple copy the file.

# Because offlineimap uses a different file name
# convention from procmail for Maildir format, we
# get procmail to use the filename header that is
# added before processing. 
# See the 'bin/syncemail' helper.
FILENAME=`formail -zx"X-Filename"`

# Remove file name header before continuing so
# that the checksums that offlineimap creates 
# are not screwed up
